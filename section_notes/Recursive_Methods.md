# Recursion

All recursion can be rewritten as iteration. Why choose one over the other?

- Iteration is more memory-efficient than recursion
- Recursion is better suited for multi-level traversal than iteration
- Code for recursion is usually simpler to read than code for iteration

All recursive functions require:

- A base case to stop execution
- A recursive case to invoke re-execution

_Recursive structures_ contain themselves in parts; an item of a kind, that can contain other items of that kind, which can contain other items...

- DOM trees and their nested elements
- Linked list items and their reference nodes
